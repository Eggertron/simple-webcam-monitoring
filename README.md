# simple-webcam-monitoring
Very quick and dirty IP Webcam monitoring to reuse old android phones.

## Setup
You'll need to have python installed in your system. To do that you can run
this script, [Python Setup Script](https://github.com/Eggertron/python-setup]). After the script has
installed pyenv you can run the following command to setup your Python version and environment,
```
pyenv install 3.6.12
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.12 webcam-env
pyenv local webcam-env
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
